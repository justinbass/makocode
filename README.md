# MakoCode🐾

A standard for color barcode printing with high density, designed for long-term archiving on paper or film. Self-contained clean-room implementation with no dependencies, single file.

Stubborn and dense as a Shiba, with no fluff. Lovingly named after my Shiba Inu, Mako 🐕.

Written entirely with codex-gpt-5, prompts included.

## Sample Barcodes

Examples of the encoded output for channel colors 1-3:

<img alt="Color 2 barcode" src="images/data_s1_c2_p01_encoded.png">
<img alt="Color 3 barcode" src="images/data_s1_c3_p01_encoded.png">
