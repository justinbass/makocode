- Features
 - Make tests more readable
 - Overlay needs --color-channels arg, mask the overlay image first.
 - Overlay won't work well on final page, need option for ECC to fill up through last page
 - Handle 15 column ppm (from convert) in decode or overlay, ignore newlines
 - Use LZMA rather than LZW compression
 - Color channels CMYKB (include black, 5 bits?) - e.g. channels options are 1, 4, 5, and 8. Each 4 pixels (5^4 states) stores 9 bits of information (2^9 encoded bits), which is 2.25 bits/pixel. Configurable colors and arbitrary bits?

- Decoding
 - Remove all headers from encoding, one by one and fix decoding for each one.

  - # MAKOCODE_PAGE_BITS
  - # MAKOCODE_PAGE_WIDTH_PX
  - # MAKOCODE_PAGE_HEIGHT_PX
  - # MAKOCODE_ECC
  - # MAKOCODE_ECC_BLOCK_DATA
  - # MAKOCODE_ECC_PARITY
  - # MAKOCODE_ECC_BLOCK_COUNT
  - # MAKOCODE_ECC_ORIGINAL_BYTES
  - # MAKOCODE_COLOR_CHANNELS
   - Detect colors automatically in decoding, optionally write out color channel information in footer
  - # MAKOCODE_PAGE_COUNT
  - # MAKOCODE_PAGE_INDEX
   - Document user can provide blank pages for their gaps. Argument could be supplied for which pages are missing. Makocode could also encode page number on each page - or else guess/try missing pages.
  - # MAKOCODE_FOOTER_ROWS
  - # MAKOCODE_FONT_SIZE
  - # MAKOCODE_FIDUCIAL_SIZE
  - # MAKOCODE_FIDUCIAL_COLUMNS
  - # MAKOCODE_FIDUCIAL_ROWS
  - # MAKOCODE_FIDUCIAL_MARGIN
  - # MAKOCODE_SUBGRID_COL_OFFSETS
  - # MAKOCODE_SUBGRID_ROW_OFFSETS
 - Fix wavy distortion test
 - All distortions test (scale 2.5x, border/dirt, stretch, wavy) in one large image per color
 - Coffee stain test, black marker test, page folded/cut test
 - One last ask to surmise any way to improve detection of a scanned image, use optar/paperbak as reference
 - Remove entire page test, with high ECC
 - Print calibration page, has mutliple settings, possibly binary search - scanned back in and the best settings are printed to the user. Data is randomly generated seed-0.

- Finalize
 - Run physical tests, check different printer/scanner/computer combinations and paper/film mediums. Leave data for a while, artificially age, different storage conditions, etc. Post findings.
 - Determine proper defaults
 - Attempt to optimize/shrink/minify/dedupe code, it still should be readable
 - Full test coverage
