Features
- Test: Discolored paper (off-white)
- Test: Wavy distortion test
- Test: All distortions test (scale 2.5x, border/dirt, stretch, wavy) in one large image per color
- Test: Blot tests or missing pages could be improved by marking their positions as known, probably by looking for big pools of a single color after thresholding.
- Test: Remove entire page test, with high ECC. Document user can provide blank pages for their gaps. Argument could be supplied for which pages are missing. Makocode could also encode page number on each page - or else guess/try missing pages.
- Color channels non-base-2 (CMYKW) works but is slow, improve speed and make test data larger
- Test: ECC approaching 100% should work, e.g. generate 100 pages and remove 99 of them.
- Overlay improvements
 - Use predictable positions (pseudorandom?) so they count as erasures with known position. Different colors actually already do this (as they are obviously known positions).
 - Improve overlay up to 50% ECC for each, including ignore - or 100% if possible.
- Footer barcode improvements
 - Rename to "metadata"
 - Triple ECC header redundancy is probably not shuffled based on whitespace at beginning of block before/after the triple commit. What if we moved if to the footer barcode?
 - Interleave footer barcode with data grid to avoid needing it at all? Or maybe a recovery mode to brute force guess it (exponentially difficult)
 - Rather than double up footer barcode, provide 100% ECC so it's more robust
 - Detect colors automatically in decoding, optionally write out color channel information in footer
 - If it's not possible (or too slow) to fully remove, compress the footer barcode
 - Footer barcode could dynamically fill the horizontal space allowed, then stretch vertically
 - Adjust footer text depending on barcode solution, could we scale it up or down as needed? Wrap it inside footer? Clean it up.
 - Title wrap in footer, confirm page-height/width applies as a hard limit
 - Test: Remove footer barcode completely
 - Test: Page height or width too small for title or footer barcode, fails to encode

Finalize
- One last ask to surmise any way to improve detection of a scanned image, use optar/paperbak as reference
- Print calibration page, has mutliple settings, possibly binary search - scanned back in and the best settings are printed to the user. Data is randomly generated seed-0.
- Run physical tests, check different printer/scanner/computer combinations and paper/film mediums. Leave data for a while, artificially age, folder paper, different storage conditions, etc. Post findings.
- Determine proper defaults
- Attempt to optimize/shrink/minify/dedupe/fix-warnings/remove-unused/constants-everywhere code, it still should be readable. Remove --ignore-errors.
- Remove all external dependencies (shell: head -c ... /dev/urandom, sort).
- Mode for no filesystem, and no includes e.g. stdin/stdout data. Use preprocessor directive around all includes: #if INCLUDES \n #include ... \n #endif . Mention in docs as part of futureproofing / self-contained solution. How to handle unicode in stdin/out?
- Much better documentation, or a spec
- 100% branch coverage, test parameterization of each combination of options
- Reorganize tests logically from simple to complex, and document each one in full.
- Suggestions and specs for archival file formats (Text: txt, images: PPM, Video: YUV4MPEG2). C++/GCC specs?
