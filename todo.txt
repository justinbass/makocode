- Remove all headers from encoding, one by one and fix decoding for each one.

- Fix wavy distortion test
- All distortions test (scale 2.5x, border/dirt, stretch, wavy) in one large image per color
- Coffee stain test, black marker test, page folded/cut test
- One last ask to surmise any way to improve detection of a scanned image, use optar/paperbak as reference
- Remove white border, or make it optional (distortion tests probably need border space)
- Use LZMA rather than LZW compression
- Color channels CMYKB (include black, 5 bits?) - e.g. channels options are 1, 4, 5, and 8. Each 4 pixels (5^4 states) stores 9 bits of information (2^9 encoded bits), which is 2.25 bits/pixel. Configurable colors and arbitrary bits?
- Overlay needs --color-channels arg, mask the overlay image first.
- Write no footer by default, make all options opt-it
- Overlay won't work well on final page, need option for ECC to fill up through last page
- Detect colors automatically in decoding, optionally write out color channel information in footer
- Handle 15 column ppm (from convert), ignore newlines
- Print calibration page, has mutliple settings, possibly binary search - scanned back in and the best settings are printed to the user. Data is randomly generated seed-0.
- Run physical tests, check different printer/scanner/computer combinations and paper/film mediums. Leave data for a while, artificially age, different storage conditions, etc. Post findings.
- Determine proper defaults
- Attempt to optimize/shrink/minify/dedupe code, it still should be readable
- Full test coverage
