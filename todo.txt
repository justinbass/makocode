- Features
 - Overlay needs explicit palette arg, threshold the overlay image first.
 - Overay needs --ignore-color arg
 - Overlay won't work well on final page
 - Color channels non-base-2, works but slow
 - 15 column ppm (from convert) in overlay, ignore newlines

- Decoding
 - Fix all commented out tests in scripts/run_test_suite.sh
 - Remove entire page test, with high ECC
 - Remove all headers from encoding, one by one and fix decoding for each one.

   - Detect colors automatically in decoding, optionally write out color channel information in footer
  - # MAKOCODE_PAGE_COUNT
  - # MAKOCODE_PAGE_INDEX
   - Document user can provide blank pages for their gaps. Argument could be supplied for which pages are missing. Makocode could also encode page number on each page - or else guess/try missing pages.

 - Wavy distortion test
 - All distortions test (scale 2.5x, border/dirt, stretch, wavy) in one large image per color
 - Discolored paper (off-white) test
 - One last ask to surmise any way to improve detection of a scanned image, use optar/paperbak as reference
 - Encode ECC header or any basic data in footer in larger dots in first/last color (2-3x the regular dots). This makes it localized but less sensitive to certain kinds of damage. Footer could be optional if normal dots are kepts, it could be a backup. Or remove regular header and make footer mandatory.
 - Print calibration page, has mutliple settings, possibly binary search - scanned back in and the best settings are printed to the user. Data is randomly generated seed-0.

- Finalize
 - Mode for no filesystem, and no includes e.g. stdin/stdout data. Use preprocessor directive around all includes: #if INCLUDES \n #include ... \n #endif . Mention in docs as part of futureproofing / self-contained solution.
 - Run physical tests, check different printer/scanner/computer combinations and paper/film mediums. Leave data for a while, artificially age, folder paper, different storage conditions, etc. Post findings.
 - Determine proper defaults
 - Attempt to optimize/shrink/minify/dedupe/fix-warnings/remove-unused/constants-everywhere code, it still should be readable
 - Dependencies section (C++, G++, Shell/Linux, Python for testing)
 - Much better documentation, or a spec
 - Suggestions and specs for archival file formats (Text: txt, images: PPM, Video: YUV4MPEG2)
 - Full test coverage, remove python dependency (scripts/ppm_transform.py)
