Features
- Footer barcode
 - Move footer barcode contents into the beginning of the data, e.g. merge it somewhat with other header data within. Rename to "metadata".
 - Triple ECC header redundancy should instead use ECC algorithm.
- Test: Page height or width too small for title or metadata, fails to encode
- Compress metadata (confirm it saves space worth the risk of corruption)
- Test: Wavy distortion test. Note, footer barcode would be distorted too. This will fail currently.
- Footer text scaling glyphs? Could use an internal vector image. May not look good in practice.
- Footer title wrap, confirm page-height/width applies as a hard limit
- Test: All distortions test (scale 2.5x, border/dirt, stretch, wavy) in one large image per color
- Test: Blot tests or missing pages could be improved by marking their positions as known, probably by looking for big pools of a single color after thresholding.
- Test: Remove entire page test, with high ECC. Document user can provide blank pages for their gaps. Argument could be supplied for which pages are missing. Makocode could also encode page number on each page - or else guess/try missing pages.
- Color channels non-base-2 (CMYKW) works but is slow, improve speed and make test data larger
- Test: ECC approaching 100% should work, e.g. generate 100 pages and remove 99 of them.
- Overlay improvements
 - Use predictable positions (pseudorandom?) so they count as erasures with known position. Different colors actually already do this (as they are obviously known positions).
 - Improve overlay up to 50% ECC for each, including ignore - or 100% if possible.
- Metadata recovery mode to brute force guess it if missing, exponentially difficult
 - Hardcoded options for decoder params (powers of 2) for easier brute-force decoding without prior knowledge.
 - What if white/black or light/dark are inverted for the metadata?

Finalize
- One last ask to surmise any way to improve detection of a scanned image, use optar/paperbak as reference
- Increase all distortions until decoding breaks, make improvements
- Print calibration page, has mutliple settings, possibly binary search - scanned back in and the best settings are printed to the user. Data is randomly generated seed-0.
- Run physical tests, check different printer/scanner/computer combinations and paper/film mediums. Leave data for a while, artificially age, folder paper, different storage conditions, etc. Post findings.
- Determine proper defaults
- Attempt to optimize/shrink/minify/dedupe/fix-warnings/remove-unused/constants-everywhere code, it still should be readable. Remove --ignore-errors.
- Remove all external dependencies (shell: head -c ... /dev/urandom, sort).
- Mode for no filesystem, and no includes e.g. stdin/stdout data. Use preprocessor directive around all includes: #if INCLUDES \n #include ... \n #endif . Mention in docs as part of futureproofing / self-contained solution. How to handle unicode in stdin/out?
- Much better documentation, or a spec
- 100% branch coverage, test parameterization of each combination of options
- Reorganize tests logically from simple to complex, and document each one in full.
- Suggestions and specs for archival file formats (Text: txt, images: PPM, Video: YUV4MPEG2). C++/GCC specs?
