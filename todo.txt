TODO:
- Fix wavy distortion test.
- Uneven scale test, e.g. 2.4 x 2.6
- All distortions (scale 2.5x, border/dirt, stretch, wavy) in one large image per color
- One last ask to surmise any way to improve detection of a scanned image, use optar/paperbak as reference
- Color channels CMYKB (include black, 5 bits?) - e.g. channels options are 1, 4, 5, and 8. Each 4 pixels (5^4 states) stores 9 bits of information (2^9 encoded bits), which is 2.25 bits/pixel.
- Print calibration page, has mutliple settings, possibly binary search - scanned back in and the best settings are printed to the user. Data is randomly generated seed-0.
- Script to create art in output that is actually readable. Possibly just apply matrix code steganographically to an input image, maybe simply use high error correction to resolve.
- Run physical tests, check different printer/scanner/computer combinations and paper/film mediums. Leave data for a while, artificially age, different storage conditions, etc. Post findings.
- Determine proper defaults
- Attempt to optimize/shrink/minify/dedupe code, it still should be readable
