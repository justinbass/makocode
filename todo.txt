- Features
 - Need option for ECC to fill up through last page
  1. Baseline Verification
      - Capture current git status and note relevant files (makocode.cpp, docs, tests).
      - Run the full regression suite (./makocode test) so we know we’re starting clean.
  2. Encoder CLI Flag & Wiring
      - Extend command_encode parsing to accept something like --ecc-tail[=MODE] and plumb that choice into the encoder config (new fields in the relevant structs).
      - Update write_encode_help (and any usage text) to describe the option.
      - Re-run the CLI/option coverage tests or at least ./makocode test to ensure parsing changes didn’t regress anything.
  3. Encoder Tail Generation
      - After frame_bit_count and page_count are known, keep requesting extra RS parity blocks (using the existing ECC builder) until page_count * bits_per_page bits
        are filled; serialize those bits onto the final page(s).
      - Emit a metadata breadcrumb (e.g., # MAKOCODE_TAIL_ECC RS255/223 extra=NNN) so other tooling can identify the tail.
      - Run encode/round-trip tests (./makocode test-low-ecc, maybe a manual encode+decode) to confirm behavior and that the new metadata is present.
  4. Decoder Tail Consumption
      - In the RS repair path, detect the new metadata or tail TLV, harvest the stored parity symbols, and feed them into the solver when baseline parity is
        insufficient.
      - Ensure graceful fallback if the tail is missing or corrupted.
      - Run decoder-heavy suites (./makocode test, ./makocode test-scan-basic, ./makocode test-border-dirt) to validate the new logic.
  5. Docs & Final Regression
      - Update README/help to explain how to enable the tail and how the decoder leverages it.
      - Execute the entire automated test suite one last time to lock in the changes.
 - Imperfect decoding, return whatever we have after ECC applies even if it's lossy
 - Color channels non-base-2, works but slow
 - Overlay needs explicit palette arg, threshold the overlay image first.
 - Overay needs --ignore-color arg
 - Overlay won't work well on final page
 - 15 column ppm (from convert) in overlay, ignore newlines

- Decoding
 - Remove all headers from encoding, one by one and fix decoding for each one.

  - # MAKOCODE_ECC_PARITY
  - # MAKOCODE_ECC_BLOCK_COUNT
  - # MAKOCODE_ECC_ORIGINAL_BYTES
  - # MAKOCODE_COLOR_CHANNELS
   - Detect colors automatically in decoding, optionally write out color channel information in footer
  - # MAKOCODE_PAGE_COUNT
  - # MAKOCODE_PAGE_INDEX
   - Document user can provide blank pages for their gaps. Argument could be supplied for which pages are missing. Makocode could also encode page number on each page - or else guess/try missing pages.

 - Fix wavy distortion test
 - All distortions test (scale 2.5x, border/dirt, stretch, wavy) in one large image per color
 - Coffee stain test, black marker test, page folded/cut test
 - One last ask to surmise any way to improve detection of a scanned image, use optar/paperbak as reference
 - Remove entire page test, with high ECC
 - Only if necessary: Encode header in image header or footer in larger dots
 - Print calibration page, has mutliple settings, possibly binary search - scanned back in and the best settings are printed to the user. Data is randomly generated seed-0.

- Finalize
 - Run physical tests, check different printer/scanner/computer combinations and paper/film mediums. Leave data for a while, artificially age, different storage conditions, etc. Post findings.
 - Determine proper defaults
 - Attempt to optimize/shrink/minify/dedupe/fix-warnings/remove-unused code, it still should be readable
 - Dependencies section (C++, G++, Shell/Linux, Python for testing)
 - Full test coverage, remove python dependency (scripts/ppm_transform.py)
