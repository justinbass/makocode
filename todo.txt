TODO:
- Fractional scale, stretch, all distortions in one large image
- One last ask to surmise any way to improve detection of a scanned image, use optar/paperbak as reference
- Any way to optionally disable all includes? It only affects pathing
- Print calibration page, has mutliple settings, possibly binary search - scanned back in and the best settings are printed to the user. Data is randomly generated seed-0.
- Script to create art in output that is actually readable. Possibly just apply matrix code steganographically to an input image.
- Color channels CMYKB (include black, 5 bits?) - e.g. channels options are 1, 4, 5, and 8. Each 4 pixels (5^4 states) stores 9 bits of information (2^9 encoded bits), which is 2.25 bits/pixel.
- Print version in footer
- Run physical tests, check different printer/scanner/computer combinations and paper/film mediums. Leave data for a while, artificially age, different storage conditions, etc. Post findings.
- Minify source code when finished
